### Summary

Expense Tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Accepts the following fields of information:
1. Expense Date
2. Description
3. Location
4. Expense Amount

To add a new expense, fill out the four fields listed above and click 'ADD EXPENSE'. If one or more of the fields is left blank, the expense will not be entered. A unique expense ID is generated every time an expense is entered.

To delete an expense, click the red 'X' to the right of the applicable expense under the 'RMV' (remove) column.

This project was my first full app that used a responsive table element. It also helped me to start thinking about making my layouts more aesthetically pleasing.
